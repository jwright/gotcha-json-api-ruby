Gotcha where I want 'cha

## DESCRIPTION

The public facing API for the [Gotcha iOS App](https://github.com/donmiller/Gotcha-iOS). Provides the heavy lifting of all the data.

## INSTALLATION

### Clone the repository

```
> git clone https://github.com/jwright/gotcha-api.git
> cd gotcha-api
```

### Install the dependencies

```
bundle install
```

### Run the sever locally

```
bundle exec rails server
```

Your api should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## RUNNING TESTS

[RSpec](http://rspec.info/) is used to create behavior-driven specs for the project. It is set as the default rake task for the project.

If there are pending database migrations, you must first migrate the test database.

```
bundle exec rails db:test:prepare
```

You can then run the tests with the following:

```
bundle exec rake
```

## DEVELOPMENT

### Database migrations

This project is using [ActiveRecord Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html).

Rails load ActiveRecord migrations rake tasks to handle our rake tasks for database migrations.

* Creating the databases

```
bundle exec rails db:create
```

* Running the migrations

```
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

To run on a different environment

```
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

* Creating a new database migration

```
bundle exec rails g migration <migration_name> <options>
```
